                    The archive is in ZIP format and contains files in JSOn format (and files uploaded by you).
                    It is possible that it does not contain all the information - some information would risk security of
                    your account. For example, the password is not included in the export.

                    The exported data is valid for seven days after sending this email.
                    After this time, they will be removed from our system.

                    After expiration, you can request a new export of your data.
