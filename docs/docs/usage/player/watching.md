# Watching

Watching mode is a feature that allows you to watch the presentation without being in the presenting mode.
This means:

- The selected slide will be synced with the presenter.
- You cannot go through the slides.
- You can interact with the slides using the interactive elements.
- You will see the drawing of the presenter.

## Accessing watching mode

Presenter (owner or co-author) can enable watching mode by clicking on the "Sharing" button in the header when in presentation mode.
This will generate a code and a link which can be shared with other users.

They can access the presentation by clicking on the link or entering the code in the "Watching" section of the player.
