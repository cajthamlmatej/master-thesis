# Collaboration

Many people (or you on different devices) can work on the same document at the same time. 
This is called "collaboration". 
You can see who else is working on the document, and you can see their changes in real-time.

You can invite others to collaborate on your document by adding their email in the share menu.
They will see the material in their dashboard and they will be able to edit it.
They cannot access destructive actions like deleting the material.

They also can present the material in the player page.

## Features

All blocks can be selected by one user at a time.
This results in a block being highlighted by border and name of the user who selected it.
It present synchronization issues when two users select the same block at the same time.

Users can switch slides and update the content of other slides at the same time.

The blocks get synchronized in real-time frequently enough to not be annoying.
