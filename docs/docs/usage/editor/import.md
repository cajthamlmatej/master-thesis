# Importing materials

You can currently import two formats of materials. You can access the import functionality from the dashboard.

## JSON

You can download your material as a JSON file from the editor. 
This file can be imported back into the editor.

This is a way to have local backup of your material.
This is recommended because we cant guarantee the data integrity.

## Markdown

You can also import a material from a markdown file.

This will create a basic structure of the material using markdown syntax of following elements:

- Text
- Link
- List (ordered and unordered)

The material is split by headers. 
H1 (`#`) is used as a title of the material.
H2 (`##`) is used as a title of the slide.

Anything after the H2 header will be added to the slide of the material.
