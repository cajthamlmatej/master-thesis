# Material

Material is a key concept in Materalist, representing some content that can be edited and played.
It can be a presentation, game, worksheet, poster or any other type of content.

Material is always created by one user and can be shared with other users with specific permissions.
It can be edited by multiple users at the same time thanks to [Collaboration](editor/collaboration.md).

It cna be presented in real-time to other users and it can allow them to interact with it.
Refer to [Watching documentation](player/watching.md) for more details.

## Settings

The material has a name.
It can be Public or Private.
It also can have set a way of presenting and/or manipulating the content.
Please refer to [Settings documentation](player/settings.md) for more details.

## Featured

The material can be featured in the dashboard.
This means that it can be shown to other users and/or on homepage of the application.
This is a way to promote the material and make it more visible to other users.

Only the owner of the material can feature it.

You can only feature a material which is public and is "worthy" of being featured.
We dont allow to feature a material which is not completely finished or is not of high quality or contains not appropriate content.
