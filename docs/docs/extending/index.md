# Extending

You can extend Materalist in several ways:

- [Creating a new plugin](./plugins/first-steps)
- [Editing the source code](./source/first-steps)

This documentation will help you understand how to do both.

:::note

This part of the documentation expects you to have some knowledge of Web development, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue and more.
If you are not familiar with these technologies, we recommend you to learn them first.
But you can still try to extend Materalist without knowing them, just be aware that you might encounter some issues.
