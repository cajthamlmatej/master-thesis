# First steps

Before you can do anything with the code of Materalist, you need to learn a few things:

- You have to be familiar with Materalist.
- Read [Architecture](./architecture), which explains how the project is structured and how the different parts are connected to each other.
- Learn how to [Setup the project](./setup) and how to run it.

Then you can start changing the code and application. 
- If you want to change the client, read [Extending the client](./client).
- If you want to change the server, read [Extending the server](./server).
- If you want to add a new language, read [Adding a new language](./adding-language).
